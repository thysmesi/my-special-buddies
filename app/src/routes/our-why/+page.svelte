            <p class="font-body">Many of my childhood memories were spent playing in the streets of my neighborhood with my next-door neighbor, Hayden. Even at a young age, I realized that Hayden's younger sister struggled to fit in with the children on our street. Her name is Payten and she was born with Down syndrome. As time went on, I realized that this is a reoccurring issue with others who have disabilities. Fast forward to college together, I told Hayden about my idea, which led to the creation of My Special Buddies. </p>
